Last updated: May 2, 2018

1.	Agreement
1.	Your use of the Svolve service is governed by this Terms of Service Agreement (the “Terms”). “Svolve” means Svolve LLC, located at 125 Kirkbride RD #5, Voorhees, New Jersey, United States, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Svolve Service. The “Svolve Services” means the services Svolve makes available through this website, including this website, the Svolve API, the Svolve Add-ons, and any other software or services offered by Svolve in connection to any of those.

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

2.	By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Svolve Privacy Policy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).

You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Svolve, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations, including any laws regarding the export of data or software. You may not use the Svolve Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Svolve Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Svolve Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Svolve Services are not intended for children under 13 and any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.

If, at the end of the Evaluation Period, Subscriber does not sign up for a paid subscription of the Services, the Agreement will automatically terminate unless Svolve agrees, in its sole discretion, to extend the Evaluation Period. Additional terms and conditions may appear on the registration website for a Trial Account and any such additional terms and conditions are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and are legally binding.
a.	ALL TRIAL ACCOUNTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TRIAL ACCOUNTS MAY BE SUSPENDED, TERMINATED, OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY REASON (OR NO REASON). SVOLVE DISCLAIMS ALL OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY UNDER THE AGREEMENT (INCLUDING LIABILITY OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR UNDER SECTION 13 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY)) FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH A TRIAL ACCOUNT, INCLUDING ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO SUBSCRIBER DATA. ANY CONFIGURATIONS OR SUBSCRIBER DATA ENTERED INTO A TRIAL ACCOUNT, AND ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS MADE TO A TRIAL ACCOUNT BY OR FOR SUBSCRIBER, MAY BE PERMANENTLY LOST IF THE TRIAL ACCOUNT IS SUSPENDED, TERMINATED, OR DISCONTINUED. SVOLVE’S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 11 (INDEMNIFICATION) DO NOT APPLY TO TRIAL ACCOUNTS.

If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Svolve immediately. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Svolve account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf.

16.	Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New Jersey, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.

2.	For any dispute with Svolve, you agree to first contact us at support@svolve.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Svolve has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Svolve claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Svolve agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Svolve are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

17.	General Legal Terms
1.

2.	There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.

3.	If Svolve provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if there is any conflict.

5.	You agree that if Svolve does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Svolve has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Svolve's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Svolve.

6.	Svolve shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.

7.	Svolve uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of Users’ personal information. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use Users’ personal information for improper purposes. Any personal information provided to the Service is done so at the risk of the User.

8.	Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the entirety of its rights and obligations under these Terms, without consent of the other party, to its affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets not involving a direct competitor of the other party. A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this paragraph shall be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of your use of the Svolve Services upon written notice to the assigning party.
