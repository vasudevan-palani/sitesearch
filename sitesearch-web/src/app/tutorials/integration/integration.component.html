<h4> Integration </h4>
<p> Sitesearch exposes the API https://api.sitesearch.svolve.com/search for all your search queries. </p>
<p> As we want to keep the integration to very simple and intuitive, a simple GET as shown below would suffice.
  Please note that since you are charged based on the number of search requests, ensure that you dont share the website token with anyone.</p>
  <pre>
    <code class="html"><![CDATA[
      Example : GET https://api.sitesearch.svolve.com/search?q=<Your query string here>&siteId=<website token here>
        ]]>
        </code>
  </pre>
  <table class="table table-bordered">
    <tr>
      <th> Query Param Name </th>
      <th> Mandatory </th>
      <th> Description </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> q </td>
      <td> Yes </td>
      <td> Search string with properly URL encoded. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> siteId </td>
      <td> Yes </td>
      <td> Token of the website. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> lang </td>
      <td> No </td>
      <td> Language filter to apply on the results. Defaults to search documents across all language </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> from </td>
      <td> No </td>
      <td> Start Index in the search results. To be used with pagination of results. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> size </td>
      <td> No </td>
      <td> Number of search results returned. To be used with pagination of results along with from</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> highlight </td>
      <td> No </td>
      <td> Provides highlight for the matching text. Defaults to true. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> suggest </td>
      <td> No </td>
      <td> Provides suggestions for spell check corrections. Defaults to true. </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p> As the query string can contain special chars, ensure that its properly URL encoded before the request is submitted to the API. You can use the from and size query params for pagination of results. </p>

<p>The sitesearch index is backed by elastic search. So the response structure is completely same as how elastich search would return. Below is an example of it.</p>
